## Description

The purpose of this app is to simulate a turn-based Pokemon battle from a classic GameBoy game. The user's and opponent's Pokemon are selected by hitting an API with a random generated number. The moves each Pokemon has and how much damage those moves do are also generated by hitting respective API endpoints. The game ends when one Pokemon's hitpoints reach zero, after which you can start a new game, generating new random Pokemon to battle with.

### TO DO

-   add type match ups
-   currently special attacks have no effect
-   no stats implemented such as attack, defense, speed etc.
